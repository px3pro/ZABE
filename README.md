ZABE - Zero-Start Adaptive Behavior Engine
Welcome to ZABE, a privacy-first AI plugin layer that runs on your device! It uses Layers 1-3 (Prophet predictions, federated learning with privacy, and contextual bandits) to power plugins across industries like Healthcare, Finance, Smart Home, Automotive, Retail, Enterprise, Government, Education, Media, and Legal, plus personal use.
What is ZABE?

Purpose: ZABE provides adaptive, on-device intelligence without sending your data to the cloud, ensuring privacy.
Industries: Healthcare, Finance, Smart Home, Automotive, Retail, Enterprise, Government, Education, Media, Legal etc.
Personal Use: Health tracking, budget coaching, and more via a mobile app.
Features: Local processing, encrypted weight aggregation, and dynamic suggestions.
